## Nikolay Kolchenko

About me: For last 10 years I've been working as Technical Support Engineer / Systems Engineer / "DevOps" Engineer in a different companies ranging from startups to corporations. 

I have a lot of experience working in a multitasking, fast paced IT environment and the willingness to grow further toward "DevOps" Engineer (alternatively Site Reliability Engineer) career.

Right now I work as DevOps mostly with AWS + Terraform as well as with everything that is related or can be related to that domain e.g. git, CI/CD tools (GH Actions, Team City)

Additionally, I'm proud of educating the "kubernetes community" via sharing my knowledge through [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1466573).


My **goal** is to learn more on how complex systems are designed, built and maintained in a real life and to grow further 
in infrastructure/”DevOps” area.
