## Goal

to learn more on how complex systems are designed, built and maintained in a real life and to grow further in infrastructure/”DevOps” area.

## Summary:

With over 12 years of experience in IT - spanning cloud platforms, DevOps, infrastructure automation, and enterprise support - I bring a well-rounded, hands-on background that aligns strongly with your requirements.  During that time I’ve taken on a variety of roles that allowed me to grow both technically and professionally. 

What makes me happy is a proper technology stack and the clear emphasis on working across environments - from deployments and observability to incident response and infrastructure-as-code. It's exactly the kind of environment I thrive in.

My responsibilities have included managing system infrastructure, troubleshooting complex technical issues, and supporting enterprise-level software deployments. I’ve also worked closely with cross-functional teams to implement solutions that improve operational efficiency and meet business goals. 


In my current and past roles, I’ve delivered infrastructure and automation projects using tools like Terraform, PowerShell, and GitLab CI, across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. I've also participated enterprise-wide migrations (Windows 10 to 11, SCCM to Intune), managed cloud provisioning workflows, and implemented cloud security and governance practices. While my deepest expertise is in Infrastructure and Cloud, I’m eager to deepen my capabilities — especially across Data Engineering.


What sets me apart is my hybrid experience between support engineering and infrastructure delivery. 

I enjoy solving operational issues just as much as automating away repetitive tasks. I'm comfortable rolling up my sleeves to debug user issues, deploy workloads, or enforce cloud policies - always with a mindset of improvement, documentation, and collaboration. I take pride in bridging gaps between engineering and operations teams and driving technical initiatives that align with business needs.
I’m enthusiastic about the chance to bring my background, skills, and “jack-of-all-trades” mindset to any team. I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your goals while continuing to grow in the AWS ecosystem.

Additionally, I'm proud of educating the "kubernetes community" via sharing my knowledge through [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1466573).

I’ve been involved in designing and executing migration strategies, ensuring minimal disruption to users and systems. My work often involved writing scripts to streamline repetitive tasks and enhance reporting capabilities. I’m comfortable working independently or as part of a team, and I place a high value on documentation, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement. I enjoy staying current with industry trends and continuously expanding my skill set to better support organizational needs.
